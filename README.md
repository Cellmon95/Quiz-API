# Quiz API
A simple api for a quiz.

## Installation
Clone the repository. Run 'composer install' and make sure you have a MySQL database. Then, copy the '.env.example' file and initialize it, and run the migration. Note that there is an SQL file in the 'database' folder named 'questions.sql', which contains some example questions that you can use. Just run it on your database.
